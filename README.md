# aoc22
Submissions for Advent of Code 2022.... see description before continuing
Kindly note:
- These are not the most readable codes as my dumb ass thought there was a time limit on the challenges so I took the fastest way out, as can be seen from code reuse or (lack of coherent) comments....nevertheless it is still fun to see how fast (or slow) I can solve the problems
- I am still very new to C++ and my understanding in Python is interfering with the codes so I will be using Python for the first few days of aoc, until I get a firmer grasp of C++ such that I'm confident in solving basic problems with it.
